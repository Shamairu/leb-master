# Live Event Broadcaster site

The site is based on Google AppEngine, so you'll need the [SDK and launcher](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads).

Once you have that, you'll need to:

1. Clone the project
2. Go to the folder and run `npm install` followed by `npm run build`
3. Launch the GAE launcher (launch a launcher is quite meta)
4. File -> Add an existing project
5. Point it to the cloned folder
6. Start it and go to `http://localhost:8080/leb`
